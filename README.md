## Observations



* The architecture of the MVC application is much more sophisticated and detailed in contrast to the WPF-EF application. 
* The Aesthetics of the MVC application are of better quality.
* The WPF-EF architecture consisted of 3 layers where one layer is dependent on only another layer.
* The MVC application architecture layout illustrated interlinked dependencies where the Controllers were dependent on the front end as well as the backend.
* The architecture of the MVC application allows for more flexibility when adding more models and controllers to the application whilst maintaining separation of concerns.
